The second approach allows aircraft to collaborate on a map of the wildfire’s state and maintain a time history of locations visited. the wildfire model, propagation model, is Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes(POMDP). And the deep Q-learning method is utilized in this paper. 
Action: At each time step, the aircraft has two possible actions: to increase or decrease the bank angle by 5°. It means left or right.
Two planes are used in simulation.
